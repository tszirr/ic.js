An implementation of the distortion unwarping for displacement mapping
as described in the paper
[Distortion-free Displacement Mapping](https://cg.ivd.kit.edu/undistort.php) (HPG 2019).

### Based on ###

This implementation would not have been possible without the work of many others, in particular the following existing codebases:
* [three.js](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js)
* [dat.gui](https://github.com/dataarts/dat.gui)
