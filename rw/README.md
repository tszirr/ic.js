# ic.js/rw - Reweighting Firefly Samples for Improved Finite-Sample Monte Carlo Estimates

An implementation of the Monte Carlo Outlier / "Firefly" Handling
technique by re-weighting of framebuffer cascades, as described in
the paper
[Reweighting Firefly Samples for Improved Finite-Sample Monte Carlo Estimates](https://cg.ivd.kit.edu/rwmc.php).
