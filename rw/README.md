# ic.js/rw - Reweighting Firefly Samples for Improved Finite-Sample Monte Carlo Estimates

An implementation of the Monte Carlo Outlier / "Firefly" Handling
technique by re-weighting of framebuffer cascades, as described in
the paper
[Reweighting Firefly Samples for Improved Finite-Sample Monte Carlo Estimates](https://cg.ivd.kit.edu/rwmc.php).

### Based on ###

This implementation would not have been possible without the work of many others, in particular the following existing codebases:
* [EXRLoader.js](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/blob/dev/examples/js/loaders/EXRLoader.js)
* [pako](https://github.com/nodeca/pako)
* [three.js](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js)
* [dat.gui](https://github.com/dataarts/dat.gui)
